# V2V-Communication-Using-Li-Fi-Technology
# Abstract
  Li-Fi is the world's most advanced technology. The project is a simple vehicle-to-vehicle communication system to prevent accidents. We use ultrasonic sensors, gas sensors, vibration sensors, LCD screens, traditional robot parts, and Li-Fi transmitters and receivers. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect the distance of the next vehicle and measure the vibration of the vehicle, while fuel sensors are used to measure the driver's alcohol level, and this information is sent to the receiver via the Li-Fi transmitter. If there is a problem with the car in front, the car behind will stop. Li-fi is connected to the microcontroller via UART function.

# Introduction
Li-Fi is a light fidelity concept known all over the world. Li-fi is based on visible light communication. Among them, we use  LED light emitting diodes to send data from the sender side to the receiver side, and photovoltaic cells to receive data from the transmitter. LiFi is rated for speeds up to 14 Gbps. Anyone can hack this Li-Fi technology.
# Proposed System
* Illumination  and  communication
* The optical output is varied at extremely high speed
